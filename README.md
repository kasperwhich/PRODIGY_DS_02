# PRODIGY_DS_02
## Introduction
This repository contains the code and analysis for Task 2 of my Data Science internship at Prodigy InfoTech. For this task, I performed data cleaning and exploratory data analysis (EDA) on a dataset of my choice. I chose the Titanic dataset from Kaggle for this analysis.
## Dataset
The Titanic dataset contains information about the passengers on the Titanic, including whether they survived or not.
## Task Objective
1. Load, understand, and clean the Titanic dataset.
2. Perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA).
## Tools and Libraries used:
1) Jupyter notebook 
2) Pandas 
3) Numpy 
4) Matplotlib & Seaborn for visualization
## Following Steps were performed:
### 1. Loading, Understanding, and Cleaning the Dataset:
- The Titanic dataset was loaded successfully.
- Missing values were handled appropriately.
- Data types were converted as necessary for analysis.

### 2. Performing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
- Univariate analysis revealed the distributions of age and fare, as well as survival counts.
-  Bivariate analysis showed survival rates by sex and class, and the age distribution among survivors.
-   Multivariate analysis highlighted relationships among multiple features and their correlation.

## Analysis Highlights
- Explored relationships between variables such as gender, passenger class, age, fare, and survival rate.
- Identified patterns and trends in the data, including the higher survival rate among females, the impact of passenger class on survival, and the relationship between age and survival.

## Conclusion
The data cleaning and exploratory data analysis performed on the Titanic dataset provided valuable insights into the factors influencing survival rates during the Titanic disaster. This analysis contributes to a better understanding of historical events and showcases the application of data science techniques in deriving meaningful insights from data.
